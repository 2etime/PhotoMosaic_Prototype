# Photo Mosaic Prototype

## This project is the prototype for rendering a photomosaic.

- To get this project to run correctly you will need to go to the `Settings.swift` file and update the property ``PATH_TO_MOSAIC_IMAGES``
to be the location you want to save mosaic images to.  You will need it to be in the format `{PATH TO FOLDER}/mosaic_images`.

- The photo api can only return about 500 images a day at 30 per request, so please.... take it easy :)

0) Update your PATH_TO_MOSAIC_IMAGES as stated above.
1) Select a main photo
2) Search for a generic image in the library text feild.
3) Run Generate Mosaic
